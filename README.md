# Forkify Project

Forkify is a fully functional recipe web application that allows users to find tasty new meal ideas, bookmark their favorite recipes, and even upload their own creations. Build with the Forkify API whose documentation can be found here:https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/v2

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, Parcel, Forkify API

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write _something_. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

Forkify's API was an excellent choice for creating this application because it offered a diverse set of recipes and great performance. Once I developed an understanding of how Recipe data was delivered from the API I was able to build the search functionality which pulled recipes from the database based on input from the user and manipulated the DOM to display the results. Implementing pagination for search results that exceeded 10 recipes was a part of this process as well.

Next, the bookmark feature was added

## Optimizations

_(optional)_

You don't have to include this section but interviewers _love_ that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those _whoa this is awesome_ or _fuck yeah I did it!_ moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
